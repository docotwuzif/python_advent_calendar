# python_advent_calendar

In this repository I will put up some small python coding challenges that can be used to learn and improve your python skills.
While some challenges will be generic, some are about the aviation industry and data processing in that area.

Even though it is called an advent calendar there will be a surpise only every second day, meaning every odd day from the first of december until 23rd of december.
The solutions to the problems will always be published one day later.

If you have suggestions or input feel free to open issues in the github repository or comment under the posts where you saw the link to this repository.
As always Google is your friend and I am looking forward to see some solutions that I did not think of.
Most of the challenges can be done within 10 lines, which does not automatically mean that those are easy problems. 

I am trying to allow the participation with as little preparation as possible. You will only need your browser to participate.
The challenges can be done either in databricks or even in the freely available google colab. Try to use the door_0 example to check your setup.

Let us all improve our skills bit by bit, exchange about it and thus be prepared to have a good start into 2021.
